# ICA reports

As part of the ME-ICA pipeline, `ICA reports` provides a reporting tool for ICA decompositions performed with [tedana](https://github.com/ME-ICA/tedana) and [aroma](https://github.com/ME-ICA/aroma).

## About

`ICA reports` originally came out as an alternative to the reports provided by [tedana](https://github.com/ME-ICA/tedana), with the aim of making manual classification of ICA components possible. At the same time, the tool aspires to be of value for ICA decompositions made with tools other than `tedana`. `ICA reports` assumes you're working with files that mimic the outputs of `tedana`.

## Installation

`ICA reports` can be installed by cloning this repository and executing the following command in the cloned repository:

```npm install```

In order to run the tool locally, two options exist:

### 1. Using a localhost

By executing the `npm start` command in the cloned repository, `ICA reports` will open in a new browser tab at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and you will be able to use the tool.

### 2. Compiling the tool

You could also compile the project so that you can use the tool just by opening an HTML file. For that, it is necessary to execute the following commands in the cloned repository.

```bash
npm run build
npx gulp
mv build/index.html build/ica-reports.html
```

> Pro tip: when you open the ica-reports.html for the first time, BOOKMARK IT ðŸ˜‰
